# Scalar Map Mode Buttons
Scalar Map Mode Buttons is a lightweight Crusader Kings III UI mod that blends the focused redesign of the [Map Mode Buttons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3616376630) mod with the clarity and functionality of Vanilla CK3.  
It recenters the map-mode panel to put Realms front-and-center, presents title tiers from County through Hegemony, and restores core map modes such as Faith, Culture, and Houses while keeping an expandable menu for additional modes.
